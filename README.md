# Quantum Mechanics Simulation Project

This project simulates various quantum mechanical phenomena, including the Schrödinger equation, quantum tunneling, wavefunctions, and more. The project involves solving key equations and visualizing the behavior of particles, such as electrons, under different conditions, using Python.

## Key Features

- **Schrödinger Equation**: Solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation for wavefunctions in potential wells and other quantum systems.
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Simulates the phenomenon of quantum tunneling where particles pass through barriers they classically shouldn't be able to overcome.
- **Wavefunction Visualizations**: Plots wavefunctions for different quantum systems, showing how particle probabilities evolve.
- **Double Slit Experiment**: Simulates the interference pattern formed when particles pass through two slits, demonstrating wave-particle duality.
- **Quantum Operators**: Implements various quantum mechanical operators like the momentum and energy operators, and computes their action on wavefunctions.

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python (version 3.x) is installed on your machine. You also need the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing functions

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-mechanics-simulation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd quantum-mechanics-simulation
```

3. Run the desired simulation or script. For example:

```bash
python double_slit_experiment.py
```

This will simulate and plot the results of the double-slit experiment with an electron beam.

## Example Simulations

### Double Slit Experiment

The code simulates the interference pattern formed when an electron beam passes through two slits. The fringe spacing is computed using the de Broglie wavelength of electrons, and the resulting interference pattern is visualized.

### Quantum Tunneling

Simulates a particle's wavefunction as it encounters a potential barrier, illustrating the phenomenon of quantum tunneling.

### Schrödinger's Equation

Solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential well and plots the wavefunction.
